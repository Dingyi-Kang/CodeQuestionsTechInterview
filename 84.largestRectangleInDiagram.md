## my initial attempt works but exceeds the time limit


## my latter tries failed and failed due to don't full understand the solution and didn't take into all cases
### solution is inspired by neetcode
### The issue tricked me most is when and how to append index after shrinking
### the essence of this alogitithm is to have an array of increasing bars at the end. The bars in middle violates this rule, will be shrinked and calculated.
### The trickly part is append what index for the new input bar. it is straingforward when new height is larger than top of the stack. it is tricky in the ohter case
