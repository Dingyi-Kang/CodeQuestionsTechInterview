## my naive solution using recursion, which in essence is brute force. However, it exceeded the time limit.

## My second solution is inspired by the shortest path algorithm. which works and beat over 40%

            for i in 0..<nums.count{
                //??? the shorter one is always on the left. because if i can reach the item on the right it must also can reach the left of it

## my final solution inspired by neetCode. Using breadth-first search. Running time of O(n)
## window/ranges of each level of decision tree --- steps = number of ranges - 1
