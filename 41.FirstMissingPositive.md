## my solution which beats 97%. But i am concerned about the memory which is not constant but O(n) because I use Set

    class Solution {
        func firstMissingPositive(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {

            var set:Set<Int> = Set<Int>()

            var minPV = Int.max
            var maxPV = 0

            for i in 0..<nums.count{
                if (nums[i]<=0){continue}
                set.insert(nums[i])
                minPV = min(minPV, nums[i])
                maxPV = max(maxPV, nums[i])
            }

            //if there is no positive
            if set.isEmpty {return 1}

            if minPV > 1 {return 1}

            //where minV == 1
            for v in minPV...maxPV{
                if !set.contains(v){return v}
            }

            return maxPV + 1
        }
    }
    
    
## This problem is hard is because the solution of O(n) time and O(1) memory is hard
### Keys/Notes: 
### 1.the potential return is from 1...sum.count
### 2. Instead of using hashSet, we can modify the array and usign negative to represent if certain potential return exist
    class Solution {
        func firstMissingPositive(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {
           //remove those useless negatives, then we can use negative to represent certain value exist
           //we have to use 0, because we want to distinguish them from those modified negatives which represent exist of certain index
           var newNums = nums.map{ max($0, 0) }

           //we know, given the length of nums, the return value should within the range of [1...num.count+1]
           //thus, this array is enough to represent if the potential return value exist. like using negative ot represent its existance 
           let n = nums.count

           for i in newNums{
               let v = abs(i)
               if v>=1, v <= n{
                   //since 0 represents non-candidate and cannot contain informatio of negative/positive
                   //in order to make it able contain negative information without affecting the index from 0...n-1, we change its magnitude to the value which cannot be used as index for the array
                   if newNums[v-1] == 0{
                       newNums[v-1] = -n - 1
                   }else{
                       //we cannot just use "*= -1"" here for the case there are duplicates in array like [1, 1]
                       newNums[v-1] = -abs(newNums[v-1])
                   }
               }
           }
        print(newNums)
           for i in 1...n{
               if newNums[i-1] >= 0 {
                   return i
               }
           }
           //if the array is from 1...n continuously
           return n + 1
        }
    }
